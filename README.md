## Prerequisites

Before getting started you should have the following installed and running:

- [X] Yarn - [instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [X] Vue CLI 3 - [instructions](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
- [X] Python 3 - [instructions](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)
- [X] Pipenv - [instructions](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv)

## Setup Template

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gtalarico/django-vue-template
$ cd django-vue-template
```

Setup
```
$ yarn install
$ pipenv install --dev && pipenv shell
$ python manage.py migrate
```

## Running Development Servers

```
$ python manage.py runserver
```

From another tab in the same directory:

```
$ yarn serve
```

The Vue application will be served from [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080/) and the Django API
and static files will be served from [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000/).

The dual dev server setup allows you to take advantage of
webpack's development server with hot module replacement.
Proxy config in [`vue.config.js`](/vue.config.js) is used to route the requests
back to django's API on port 8000.

If you would rather run a single dev server, you can run Django's
development server only on `:8000`, but you have to build build the Vue app first
and the page will not reload on changes.

```
$ yarn build
$ python manage.py runserver
```
